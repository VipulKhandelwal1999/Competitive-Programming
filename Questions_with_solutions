1. How many square tiles of size a are required to pave the rectangle of m*n?
-> ceil(m/a) * ceil(n/a)
CODE:-
 double n, m, a, x, y;
    int result;
    cin >> n >> m >> a;
    x = m/a;
    y = n/a;
    result = ceil(x)*ceil(y);
    
2.You are given a rectangular board of M × N squares. Also you are given an unlimited number of standard domino pieces of 2 × 1 squares. 
You are allowed to rotate the pieces. You are asked to place as many dominoes as possible on the board so as to meet the following conditions:
 1. Each domino completely covers two squares.

 2. No two dominoes overlap.

 3. Each domino lies entirely inside the board. It is allowed to touch the edges of the board.

Find the maximum number of dominoes, which can be placed under these restrictions.
-> floor(m*n*0.5)
CODE:-
int n, m;
    cin >> m >> n;
    cout << floor(m*n*0.5);
    
3. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 150) — the number of statements in the programme.
Next n lines contain a statement each. Each statement contains exactly one operation (++ or --) and exactly one variable x (denoted as letter «X»). 
Thus, there are no empty statements. The operation and the variable can be written in any order.
-> To find a substring in string we can use like:-
CODE:-
    int n, x=0;
    string str;
    size_t found;
    cin >> n;
    while(n--){
        cin >> str;
        found = str.find("+");
        if(found != string::npos){
            x++;
            continue;
        }
        found = str.find("-");
        if(found != string::npos){
            x--;
        }
    }
    cout << x;
